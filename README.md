WIreless-Temperature-Sensoring-Project
======================================
* This project was created part of a two-term senior design course sequence in Electrical Engineering at San Francisco State University 
* Our first main purpose was to make a portable wireless temperature control sensor, display the temperature output approximately only for usage in the car and/or for camping within 40 feet distance
* We improved our project by adding some features which can even control the temperature by users so that it can be used for homes' and companies'  temperature improvement at a very cheap price. 
* Our design detected temperature, transmitted and received signals, adjusted temperature and displayed temperature.
- WTCS can sense the temperature as far as 40 feet apart. 
- WTCS has a temperature sensor (DS18B20), PICAXE08M and PICAXE18X microcontrollers, two AM RT4-433.9 Frequency Transmitters, an AM HRR3-433.9ND Receiver, and two Fans. 
- WTCS is a user-friendly temperature sensoring device which helps users to detect and control the temperature of the area they are in.
